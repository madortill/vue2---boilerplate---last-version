## Boilerplate Instructions - read before start coding
This template should help get you started developing with Vue 2 in Vite.  
Thid is a boilerplate created by the command "npm init@vue2".

**IMPORTANT! Before first upload - change <REPO_NAME> in `./vite.config.js` to your repository name.**  

*Project Setup - before the first run:* run npm install  
*run for development purposes:* npm run dev

### Tips I found while working🤩
- Start every static assets' url with "@" (equivalent to src directory), so the assets will appear as they should in final site.  
- In order to register an event listener to native event (like "click") on a component, add native after the event name like `@click.native = "function"`
